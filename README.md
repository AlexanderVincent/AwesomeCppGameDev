# Awesome list of C++ GameDev project

This list is still a work in progress.    
I have to filter it now, cause a lot of libraries here does the same things.  
I want to store here only good quality libraries. If you want to add projects here, do not push a request, open an issue and I'll check.  
C++, C, C#, Lua, and some exceptions for other languages.
